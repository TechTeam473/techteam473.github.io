Fable

You wake up in an unfamiliar cave with a floor covered in glyphs, your head spinning and no idea where you are. You are completely unaware of the monumental task that lays before you.
Description

Fable is developed in Unity using C#. We use Blender for our models, and several different art programs including Clip Studio Paint, GIMP, and Krita. Our concept art is drawn by hand, and then some is put through stable diffusion.

Project status

We have much of the broad story planned. We still need the minute details.

We have character movement and item selection implemented and mostly functional.

Thank you for your interest <3 ~TechTeam473
